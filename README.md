# Termux upgrade version

# https://github.com/termux/termux-app The original address

## This is changed according to the address of the original author

## Application name (Termux) and package name (com.termux) should be different if you going to distribute your application.

## Usage of the official Termux apt repositories by third-party applications is not allowed. By the way, growing traffic from third-party ## things most likely will end in certain actions in order to disable wasting of our monthly bandwidth.

## Login motd should be changed too. Forks aren't supported in our community pages and bug tracker.

## If you are going to distribute the application, a source code must be freely available in order to be GPLv3 compliant.
